This Python project was implemented to safeguard a three-phase squirrel cage induction motor by continuously monitoring currents in its R, Y, and B phases. It identifies faults such as overcurrent, overload, short circuit, and prime mover decoupling, triggering relay trip commands to protect the motor from potential damage. The system includes password-protected settings for adjusting relay parameters and a reset function for maintenance purposes. With user-friendly color-coded prompts for inputs and outputs, this project ensures efficient fault detection and automated relay control critical for motor protection in industrial applications.
